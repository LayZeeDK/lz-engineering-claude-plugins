# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-04)

**Core value:** `lz-tpp` helps Claude choose the next code transformation by TPP priority during red-green-refactor TDD, and explains the premise on demand. lz-tdd@0.0.2 adds `lz-refactor` to drive the refactor step.
**Current focus:** Phase 7 — Fowler Catalog (Refactoring, 2nd ed)
**Milestone:** lz-tdd@0.0.2 (lz-refactor Skill) -- planning

## Current Position

Phase: 7 (Fowler Catalog (Refactoring, 2nd ed)) — EXECUTING (content complete; verification pending)
Plan: Wave 4 DONE -- 07-10 authored the 24 Ch.3 smell leaves (oracle-converged 24/24 over 2 rounds; 0 escalations), the navigation-only smells.md index, and the finalized 62-row fowler-catalog/README.md. The FULL checker battery is GREEN (the phase gate). All 10 phase-7 plans complete.
Status: All waves done. Full battery GREEN at the 07-10 gate -- extract-samples 124 modules tsc --strict, check-catalog 62/62 + Use-when mirror, check-smells 24/24 + navigation index, check-crossrefs 291 links + 20 inverse pairs (no self-refs), check-principles 8/8, check-hygiene ASCII+email; `claude plugin validate .` passes. Clean-room firewall held throughout (author/revise BLIND; only oracle-reviewer subagents read .oracle/). NEXT (phase close): verify_phase_goal (gsd-verifier) -> secure-phase -> validate-phase -> extract-learnings.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap (0.0.2): 6 phases (6-11) mirroring 0.0.1's shape and the content-dependency chain -- scaffold -> Fowler catalog -> Kerievsky catalog -> coach behavior + principle-backing -> distribution -> evals.
- Roadmap (0.0.2): phase numbering continues from the previous milestone (0.0.1 ended at Phase 5), so this milestone starts at Phase 6.
- Roadmap (0.0.2): Fowler (Phase 7) precedes Kerievsky (Phase 8) because Kerievsky refactorings compose named Fowler primitives and fold into the Fowler-established smell taxonomy.
- Roadmap (0.0.2): CCH + PRIN combined in Phase 9 -- the coach behavior and the no-oracle principle cross-refs (Beck x2, Feathers) are authored together on top of both catalogs.
- Roadmap (0.0.2): EVL-01/EVL-02 isolated in Phase 11 as a late, non-blocking pass; Phases 6-10 (the public ship) do not depend on it.
- Milestone constraints baked into phases: owner acts as authoritative oracle (Fowler/Kerievsky/GoF verified against the owner's e-book/web editions at checkpoints -- which include all 66 Fowler refactorings, print-absent entries included; print-absent entries + Split Phase provenance-labeled); Beck/Feathers unowned -> high-confidence core only, tagged no-oracle; no verbatim book prose/code in the shipped tree; all TS/JS samples tsc --strict-clean; progressive disclosure grounded in the angular-developer skill + skill-creator/plugin-dev guidance + in-house lz-tpp.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 6 (06-01): lz-refactor scaffold shipped -- dual-mode-by-omission router (name+description only), five references/ stubs, two splittable catalog subdirs behind thin indexes; Wave-0 checker + claude plugin validate both exit 0.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 6: SKILL.md kept lean at 70 lines (under ~90-150 soft target, well under 500 cap); content deferred to references/ per progressive disclosure.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 6 carry-forward (D-09): Phases 7 and 8 MUST open an AskUserQuestion oracle-access checkpoint (Fowler e-book/web ISBN 9780135425664, Kerievsky book, GoF e-book) before authoring catalog content; recorded inline in the catalog stubs.
- [Phase 07]: Phase 7 (07-09): Ch.12 dealing-with-inheritance 11 leaves converged 11/11 -- catalog 62/62 (all seven catalog chapters authored). The DST-04 near-verbatim gate fired on ACCIDENTAL collision (push-down-method blind draft matched the source's short imperative steps; reworded blind, cleared). spirit/judgment held `correct` across all 11 despite the judgment-heavy chapter; every revise was completeness/aptness (a dropped final mechanics step, a missing secondary motivation, a plausible-but-incomplete cited sibling).
- [Phase 07]: Phase 7 (07-01, wave 1): built the NON-shipped FWL-01..04 validation harness at .claude/skills/lz-refactor-workspace/ (pinned typescript@6.0.3, one-module-per-fence tsc --strict extractor + 4 node-builtin checkers). Checkers gate on exit code and assert name IDENTITY not cardinality (closes WR-02). RED against the empty catalog is the expected wave-1 baseline; FWL-01..04 close only when the content plans (waves 2-4) turn the battery GREEN. — D-03 asks for a committed re-runnable harness (not Phase-3 ad-hoc extraction). Instruments-first (Nyquist scaffold) makes FWL-01..04 machine-checkable before any oracle content lands.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None open. lz-tdd@0.0.1 shipped with all prior concerns resolved:

- RESOLVED (2026-07-02): repo renamed to plural `lz-engineering-claude-plugins`, GitHub repo created, `origin` wired, `main` in sync; `claude plugin marketplace add LayZeeDK/lz-engineering-claude-plugins` clones + validates the marketplace and resolves `./plugins/lz-tdd` (closed D-13's ship-time deferral).
- RESOLVED (2026-07-03): triggering accuracy (SKILL-05 / EVAL-01) validated empirically via the native eval harness -- 100% recall / 100% specificity on the shipped description.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-07-05
Stopped at: Wave 4 (07-10) DONE -- 24/24 smells converged, indexes finalized, full battery GREEN (commits 77572bf, 5341121). Phase-7 content complete; phase-close audits (verify/secure/validate/extract) pending.
Resume file: (Wave 4 complete; .continue-here.md removed)

## Operator Next Steps

- Wave 4 (07-10) DONE: the 24 Ch.3 smell leaves converged 24/24 (2 rounds, 0 escalations), smells.md is
  a navigation-only recognize-by index, fowler-catalog/README.md lists all 62 refactorings (Ch.6-12) with
  mirrored Use-when lines. The FULL battery is GREEN and `claude plugin validate .` passes. Commits
  77572bf (leaves) + 5341121 (indexes). All 10 phase-7 plans complete.
- Next (phase close): verify_phase_goal (gsd-verifier) -> secure-phase -> validate-phase ->
  extract-learnings (per CLAUDE.md GSD rules), then the milestone can advance to Phase 8 (Kerievsky).
