# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-04)

**Core value:** `lz-tpp` helps Claude choose the next code transformation by TPP priority during red-green-refactor TDD, and explains the premise on demand.
**Current focus:** lz-tdd@0.0.2 -- defining requirements + roadmap for the lz-refactor skill
**Milestone:** lz-tdd@0.0.2 (lz-refactor Skill) -- planning

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 5 phases following the content-dependency chain (scaffold -> source distillation -> skill authoring -> distribution -> optional-final evals).
- Roadmap: EVAL-01/EVAL-02 isolated in Phase 5 as an optional-final, non-blocking pass; Phases 1-4 (the public ship) do not depend on it.
- Roadmap: `.gitignore` (DIST-04) placed in Phase 1 as part of the repo-hygiene skeleton so the repo commits clean from the first commit.
- Roadmap: canonical transformation list is the revised 14-item FibTPP list; the 12-item original is documented for provenance (resolved in Phase 2).
- [Phase ?]: Phase 1 scaffold: version 0.0.1 lives only in plugin.json, never the marketplace entry (avoids version-masking; MKT-05)
- [Phase ?]: claude plugin validate . --strict passes clean with the optional top-level marketplace description present (assumption A1 confirmed empirically)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None open. lz-tdd@0.0.1 shipped with all prior concerns resolved:

- RESOLVED (2026-07-02): repo renamed to plural `lz-engineering-claude-plugins`, GitHub repo created, `origin` wired, `main` in sync; `claude plugin marketplace add LayZeeDK/lz-engineering-claude-plugins` clones + validates the marketplace and resolves `./plugins/lz-tdd` (closed D-13's ship-time deferral).
- RESOLVED (2026-07-03): triggering accuracy (SKILL-05 / EVAL-01) validated empirically via the native eval harness -- 100% recall / 100% specificity on the shipped description.

## Deferred Items

## Quick Tasks Completed

| Date | Slug | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 2026-07-02 | triage-lz-tpp-doc-review | complete | All 5 findings resolved: 1/2/4 applied (+ `:223-224` leak); #3 aggressive trim (provenance -> `.planning/` companion, 224->116 lines); #5 keep `.planning/` committed |
| 2026-07-04 | changelog-and-github-release | complete | Added root CHANGELOG.md (lz-tdd@0.0.1 entry, commit 003219b) + pushed; published GitHub Release lz-tdd@0.0.1 "First Release" on the lz-tdd@0.0.1 tag |
| 2026-07-04 | retag-milestone-lz-tdd | complete | Renamed identifier v0.0.1 -> lz-tdd@0.0.1 across git tag, GitHub Release, GSD milestone (.planning/ + archive files), and the CHANGELOG entry -- plugin-scoped versioning for the multi-plugin marketplace |
