# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-02)

**Core value:** `lz-tpp` helps Claude choose the next code transformation by TPP priority during red-green-refactor TDD, and explains the premise on demand.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — tpp source distillation
**Milestone:** 0.0.1 (first release)

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 5 phases following the content-dependency chain (scaffold -> source distillation -> skill authoring -> distribution -> optional-final evals).
- Roadmap: EVAL-01/EVAL-02 isolated in Phase 5 as an optional-final, non-blocking pass; Phases 1-4 (the public ship) do not depend on it.
- Roadmap: `.gitignore` (DIST-04) placed in Phase 1 as part of the repo-hygiene skeleton so the repo commits clean from the first commit.
- Roadmap: canonical transformation list is the revised 14-item FibTPP list; the 12-item original is documented for provenance (resolved in Phase 2).
- [Phase ?]: Phase 1 scaffold: version 0.0.1 lives only in plugin.json, never the marketplace entry (avoids version-masking; MKT-05)
- [Phase ?]: claude plugin validate . --strict passes clean with the optional top-level marketplace description present (assumption A1 confirmed empirically)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Physical folder + GitHub rename to plural `lz-engineering-claude-plugins` is a ship-time step OUTSIDE an active session (renaming the cwd mid-session breaks tooling); committed manifests/docs use the plural name from the start.
- Triggering accuracy (SKILL-05 / EVAL-01) is empirically resolvable only -- via the skill-creator eval loop in Phase 5, not by intuition in earlier phases.
